# Battle Simulation
By: CritX, inspired by onlymx13.
I used Node.js, HTML5 and JavaScript to make this.

Typically I work in Python. However, I made this program to allow for play between multiple devices, something that is more finicky in Python than in HTML5/JavaScript.

Hopefully I can make major improvements on this program.
